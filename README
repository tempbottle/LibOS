========================================================
An example shows how LibOS works.

/                           <-- rootfs

/LibOS                      <-- cwd
|- Applications/            <-- apps installed here
   |- Hello/                <-- a simple hello world program 
                                (calls system-wide library)
   |- Gtk3/                 <-- a GTK3-based hello world program 
                                (calls userland library)
|- Default/                 <-- default programs, installed by default
|- Config/                  <-- the same as /etc, the system will 
                                write conf back to /etc
|- Libraries/               <-- non-sys, only for apps, libraries
   |- Msg                   <-- print a boring hello world program
   |- Headers               <-- stores a lib's headers, this shouldn't
                                be seen in end-users' eyes.
|- System/                  <-- LibOS core
|- Users/                   <-- the same as /home, could be read and 
                                written by users, or just drop this dir??

LICENSE
=======
Currently, 2-clause BSD license.

WHAT DOES "LIBOS" MEAN?
=======================
/laibos/, libre operating system.

WHAT DOES "EXAMPLE" MEAN?
=========================
The LibOS implementation is still experimental.

If this implementation of LibOS grows fast, it
may be a real product. :-)

WHAT DOES "RUBY-POWERED" MEAN?
==============================
You can install a whole LibOS environment on any platforms that 
LLVM and Ruby support.

WHAT DOES "LLVM-BASED" MEAN?
============================
All of its applications are cross-platform!

WHAT DOES "FREEBSD-BASED" MEAN?
===============================
LibOS provides a full working environment out of box.
You can start your work even you're out of LibOS itself.

NOTES
=====
* Only GTK+ and its friends (including Clutter, Mx)
  are supported.
* Only FreeBSD is supported.

Other support could be provided by joining the 
SupGroup.

You'd better not use C++-based library, because the ABI may be different 
across machines!

PROBLEMS
========
Well.. Sorry but you must make a directory in /LibOS right now.

You can do it by running:
# mkdir /LibOS
# chown [YourUserName] /LibOS
